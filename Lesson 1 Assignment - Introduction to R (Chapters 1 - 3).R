# Lesson 1 Assignment - Introduction to R (Chapters 1 - 3)

# Your assignment is to write the commands instructed in the comments below. To run your
# commands, simply hit Ctrl+Enter (command+return on a MAC) when the cursor is on that 
# command line. You can also type commands directly into the Console below, but you must
# save them in this file for your assignment.


# 1. Assign the variable x with a value of 10


# 2. Print out x


# 3. Assign the variable y with a value of 180


# 4. Calculate y / x


# 5. Create variable z with value TRUE


# 6. Create variable a with value "nice"


# 7. Try adding a and x


# 8. This doesn't work because one of these is a non-numeric argument. Check the class of 
# each variable you've created to see which isn't numeric.

# 9. Let's create our first vector. Name it v1 and have it contain numbers 1 through 9. 


# 10. Print out v1


# 11. Calculate the sum of the values in v1


# 12. Create a new vector, v2, by squaring v1


# 13. Calculate the sum of the values in v2


# 14. We believe that the sum of v2 is larger than the sum of v1. Confirm this using 
# greater than/less than symbols.


# 15. Calculate how much bigger the sum of v2 is than the sum of v1


# 16. Create a new vector called pts that contains these values in order:
# 111, 106, 105, 102, 100


# 17. Calculate the mean of pts. (HINT: The function *mean()* calculates the mean of 
# a vector within the parentheses.)


# 18. Use brackets to output the 3rd value in pts


# 19. Create matrix named m1 with 7 columns and 4 rows. The matrix should contain the 
# values 1 to 28. Row 1 should have the numbers 1 to 7. (HINT: You may use either ncol or 
# nrow or both to specify the matrix dimensions.)

# 20. Select the 3rd value in the 2nd row of m1

# 21. Matrix m1 represents the month of February (when it starts on a Sunday). However, 
# we should add column and row titles. First create a vector of day labels. Call it days 
# and make it contain "Su", "M", "T", "W", "Th", "F", "Sa".


# 22. Now make another vector named wk that contains "wk1", "wk2", "wk3", "wk4".


# 23. Now add days as the column names and wk as the row names.

# 24. Look at your new matrix


# 25. We want to add the first week of March... create a new vector named mar containing 
# values 1 through 7.


# 26. Now add mar onto m1 in the appropriate place using rbind

# 27. Look at your new matrix


# 28. Create a vector called "Wednesdays" that includes the Wednesday dates from m1. 
# (Select column 4 from m1.)


#29. Create a vector called "Fridays" that includes the Friday dates from m1. (Select
# the "F" column from m1.)


#30. Show the third week of February by selecting "wk3" from m1.


#31. Check whether the entries from "wk1" of m1 are equivalent to "mar" from m1.
# (We know they are equivalent, so we should see a vector of 7 TRUEs.)


#32. Create a vector called "HiSat" that indicates whether the Saturday date is greater
# than 14. (It should have 5 TRUE/FALSE entries.)


#33. Use HiSat to select the rows of m1 where the Saturday date is greater than 14.


#34. Create a vector called "LowSun" that indicates whether the Sunday date is less 
# than or equal to 14. 


#35. Use LowSun to select the rows of m1 where the Sunday date is less than or equal
# to 14.
